This project was created by Aditya Kondepudi, Chris Anto, Sam Lipschitz for Gateway Data Science, an introductory data science course at Johns Hopkins University.

The goal of this project was to leverage the skills we learned in class to investigate a relationship. The file in reports goes into more detail on exactly what we did, but this project uses data science libraries within python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch) to investigate the relationship between weather and flight delays.

Due to computing and time restraints, we focused on data on flights departing from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR).
